## Other Instructions regarding the Technical Test

* I tried to finish this project as I have time constraint  and managing a UAT and Live release during the week and the coming next week.

* I think I could have done better in different ways or with different languages

* My other work that I've been practising and doing some work in my free time:  https://github.com/khana25/
