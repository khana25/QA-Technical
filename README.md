## Other Instructions regarding the Technical Test

* I tried to finish this project as I have time constraint  and managing a UAT and Live release during the week and the coming next week.

* I think I could have done better in different ways or with different languages

* Please find and review my other projects and I have added the following user to one of my other private repository to review some of that code too. Please find my other private repository:  https://github.com/khana25/RubyAutomationTests
